# Hey everyone!

My name is Willow Carretero Chavez. As of the writing of this post, I am about to enter my final semester of an undergraduate degree in biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

I'm hoping to use this blog to share various things I've learned over the years in the realms of software engineering, biology, and the intersection of the two. Online tutorials and blogs have been a huge resource for me over the years, and I want to pay it forward!

Posting will likely be sporadic as I figure out how much effort I want to put into this. My current plan is to start working through problems on [rosalind.info](https://rosalind.info), a database of bioinformatics problems, and posting written-up solutions here. Keep an eye out for the first post in that series soon!

Thanks for reading, and I hope what I share is of use to you!
